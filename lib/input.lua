--[[ Vocabulary

Key: 
A property of an input device. The space bar is a key of the keyboard device, 
and the mouse wheel is a key of the mouse device, but the mouse's position is
also a key of the mouse device.
There are a few types of key types: 
  * button, which is a traditional on/off switch, like a key on a keyboard, or 
    a button on a mouse or gamepad; 
  * axis1D, which is a value that can altered in one of two directions, like a 
    scroll wheel, or a single direction of a joystick; 
  * axis2D, which is a pair of values that can be altered in one of two 
    directions in two different dimensions, like a gamepad's joystick, or the 
    mouse's position;

State: 
An ongoing property of a device's key.
  * button: is_pressed,
  * axis1D: x,
  * axis2D: x, y,

Device: 
A physical means of obtaining user input. A mouse, a keyboard, a gamepade.

DeviceManager: 
A translator from button presses to standardised virtual inputs, converting from
different types of gamepads, for example.
DeviceManager need to have the following properties:
  * get_state(key_id) -> state
  * 

Device Event: 
A "physical" input from the player. A press of a button on a gamepad.

Virtual Event: 
A standardised event format, in terms of keys and referencing devices, that can 
be passed to schemes to be translated into game events.

Game Event: 
A context-dependent event that is relevent to the gameplay. For example, 
pressing space would be a device event and a virtual event, but could, in 
certain contexts and schems, translate to a 'jump' game event.

Context: 
An environment in which virtual events translate to game events. The 'gameplay' 
context might translate a mouse click into shooting, but the 'menu' context 
would instead translate it into selection of a menu item.

Scheme: 
A collection of mappings from virtual events to game events, within contexts.
Schemes need to have the following properties:
  * uses_device(device_id) -> boolean
  * handle_event(event)

controllable characters will have a component marking them as controllable.
this component will reference an input mapping scheme.
this input mapping will be what?
binding -> action
binding can be one of the following:
  * a button press (mouse click, keyboard press, gamepad button press)
  * a 1D axis (mouse scrolling)
  * a 2D axis (WASD, gamepad D-Pad, gamepad joystick, mouse movement)
an action fires a named event with a table containing the following info:
  * 
  * 
  * 
binding -> state
  * is button down (mouse pressed, keypressed, gamepad buttom pressed)
  * is combination of buttons down (buttons are flags/values, return total of flags)
    eg. w = (0, -1), a = (-1, 0), s = (0, 1), d = (1, 0) - returns total

physical inputs

 1. mouse pressed left button
 2. mouse moved
 3. gamepad right axis moved up
 4. keyboard pressed 'P'
 5. keyboard released ' '

-> standardised virtual input

 1. { device=1, devicename="mouse",     keyname="left button", key="1", action="press",   params={} }
 2. { device=1, devicename="mouse",     keyname="position",    key="0", action="move",    params={dx, dy} }
 3. { device=3, devicename="gamepad_1", keyname="right axis",  key="9", action="move",    params={dx, dy} }
 4. { device=2, devicename="keyboard",  keyname="p",           key="p", action="press",   params={} }
 5. { device=2, devicename="keyboard",  keyname="space",       key=" ", action="release", params={} }

actions:
  * press
  * release
  * move

-> active input mapping schemes (eg. keyboard+mouse FPS gameplay) -> 

 1. shoot
 2. look
 3. look
 4. open inventory
 5. jump

OR active input mapping schemes (eg. keyboard+mouse menu) -> 

 1. select
 2. hover
 3. ---
 4. ---
 5. select


physical states

 1. keyboard pressed?
 2. mouse position

standardised virtual input query

 1. { device=1, key="1" } -> { device=1, key="1", state = {is_pressed=true} }
 2. { device=1, key="0" } -> { device=1, key="0", state = {x=x, y=y} }

states:
  * is_pressed
  * position
